# Technologies

This project helped me develop my skills and understanding on how to write a fullstack project using technologies such as:
nodejs, docker, typescript, swagger, functional programing.

## Backend

express - using swagger to validate schema, throttling incoming requests to avoid spam / brute force
mongodb - persistence layer
redis - caching layer
mocha - testing flows e2e

## Frontend

React, redux, bootstrap

# how to run

1. build the app - run "scripts/build"
2. raise the docker images - run "scripts/start"
3. shutdown docker images - run "scripts/stop"
